<h1>Thrombolaize: Your Rapid Stroke Care Triage Tool</h1>

<p>Thrombolaize is a <b>Jetpack-Compose Android application</b> that helps stroke teams triage patients by instantly analyzing uploaded CT scans with an on-device AI model. Alongside imaging, clinicians enter age, sex, onset window and arrival time, and the app returns an evidence-based IV-tPA recommendation while logging every decision to Firebase for audit. End-to-end encryption plus Google Cloud-KMS ensure patient privacy, and a local cache keeps the workflow alive offline.</p>

<p>The codebase uses Hilt, Room, DataStore and reactive StateFlow. Suggestions and constructive criticisms are welcome; open an issue or PR to join the mission of accelerating stroke care everywhere.</p>
